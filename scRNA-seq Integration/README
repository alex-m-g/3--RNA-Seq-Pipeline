## scRNA-seq Integration
Integration of single-cell sequencing datasets across experimental batches, donors, or conditions.
Integrative analysis helps match shared cell types and cell states across datasets. This is important to boost statistical power and facilitate accurate comparative analysis across datasets.

### Integration Goals
- Identify cell subpopulations that are present in both datasets.
- Obtain cell-type markers that are conserved in both controls and stimulated cells.
- Compare the datasets to find cell-type specific responses to stimulation.

### Dataset
- The dataset comes from human PBMC (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) from two conditions: (1) interferon-stimulated and (2) control cells.
- We will integrate the two conditions together to jointly identify cell subpopulations across datasets, and then explore how each group differs across conditions.
