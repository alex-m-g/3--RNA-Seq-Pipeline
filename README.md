# scRNAseq Data Analysis ToolKit

## Project Overview:
This project involves creating and optimizing a bioinformatics pipeline tailored for analyzing 3'-end sequencing data from single-cell RNA-seq experiments. The pipeline will be designed to handle large datasets efficiently, support multiple omics data types, and be easily adaptable to various research needs.

## Objectives:
### (1) Pipeline Development:
- Develop a comprehensive pipeline for processing and analyzing 3'-seq data, including raw data processing, quality control, alignment, and quantification of gene expression.
- Incorporate steps for integrating additional omics data (e.g., ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) if available.

### (2) Pipeline Optimization:
- Optimize the pipeline for speed and scalability, enabling it to handle large-scale single-cell RNA-seq datasets.
- Implement parallel processing and cloud computing capabilities to enhance performance.

### (3) Data Visualization:
- Integrate tools for visualizing the results, including gene expression profiles, differential expression analysis, and clustering of cells.
- Develop interactive dashboards using R Shiny or Python Dash for exploring the data.

### (4) Documentation and User Guide:
- Provide clear documentation and a user guide to help others install, run, and modify the pipeline for their research needs.
- Include examples of how to run the pipeline on sample datasets.

### (5) Benchmarking:
- Benchmark the pipeline against existing 3'-seq analysis tools to evaluate its performance, accuracy, and efficiency.
- Provide a comparative analysis report.

## Tools and Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python, R
Bioinformatics Tools: STAR, Salmon, Seurat, Scanpy
Data Visualization: ggplot2, matplotlib, R Shiny, Python Dash
Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud (optional, for scalability)
Version Control: Git/GitHub

## Expected Deliverables:
A fully functional and documented 3'-seq analysis pipeline.
A GitHub repository containing the pipeline, documentation, example datasets, and usage instructions.
A comparative benchmarking report.
