# 3--RNA-Seq-Pipeline

## Project Overview:
This project involves the creation and optimization of a bioinformatics pipeline tailored for analyzing 3'-end sequencing data from single-cell RNA-seq experiments. The pipeline will be designed to handle large datasets efficiently, support multiple omics data types, and be easily adaptable to various research needs.
